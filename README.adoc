== File structure

=== `/k8s`

The `/k8s` directory contains all the files necessary to install the stack on a kubernetes cluster. You will find a few
utility `.sh` scripts you can use to perform actions against your k8s application.

* `stack.create.secrets.sh`: it creates all the secrets used by the stack deployment;
* `stack.apply.sh`: it applies (or deploys) all the k8s configuration files under the `/k8s/config` directory;
* `stack.status.sh`: it displays the status of your deployment;
* `stack.delete.sh`: it deletes all the objects created by the `stack.apply.sh` command;
* `stack.log.sh`: it displays the logs of a given deployment. For example, inorder to see the log of the `db` deployment,
you should execute `./stack.log.sh db`;
* `stack.open.browser.sh`: it opens a incognito chrome browser at the home page of your deployed `todo` application;

=== `/pwd`
